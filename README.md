# car_price_prediction
# Linear Regression VS Lasso VS XGBOOST

## Project Overview
This project compares the performance of three different regression techniques—Linear Regression, Lasso Regression, and XGBoost—on a dataset of car features to predict the selling price of the cars. The goal is to evaluate and compare the effectiveness of these models in terms of prediction accuracy.

## Dependencies
The following Python libraries are used in this project:
- pandas
- matplotlib.pyplot
- seaborn
- sklearn (for Linear Regression, Lasso, metrics, and model selection)
- xgboost
